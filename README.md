Steve Coleman-Williams' solution to Spruce tech test

## Still to do
I ran out of time from the 2 hours, so I have made a start on the backend API however its not integrated into the main app, nor is it complete

## Quickstart

### client
- Make sure you have **node** installed
- `cd client`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

### server
- Make sure you have **node** >= v20 installed
- `cd server`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn start`
